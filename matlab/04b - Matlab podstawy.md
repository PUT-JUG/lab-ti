These are the tasks that you will have to perform during classes. You can always ask the tutor for help or explanation of the assignment. Bare in mind that the teacher can modify the assignments, omit, or add an additional one - so **PAY ATTENTION**.

Most of the class scripts will finish with:

## Zadanie końcowe :fire: :hammer:

These are the tasks that you will be performing after finishing tutor-guided script. If you do not finish all assignments during the class remember to complete them at home!

Sometimes a homework will be included in the script, marked as:

## Zadanie domowe :boom: :house:

**HOMEWORK SOMETIMES CAN BE GRADED!**, also your teacher can assign you with additional homework apart from the one included in script.
